I may want to postpone if another day this week is expected to be nicer.\n* Birthdays, holidays, and other significant future events have a bad habit of sneaking up on me. I wish I could bring upcoming events to my awareness more gradually.\n\n\n\n### Existing solutions fall short\n\n* It's difficult to view weather and calendar information simultaneously for comparison\n* Significant events become lost among the clutter of less significant events\n* Poor visual hierarchy and context-switching between multiple apps increases cognitive load",
